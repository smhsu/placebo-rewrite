This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Displaying Tweets statically
You might want to work on the frontend without the backend Twitter infrastructure, for example if you don't have a
Twitter account or if you don't want to exceed your Twitter Developers account's rate limits.  You can skip the login
flow and directly render a predefined set of tweets (the ones in `sampleTweets.json`) by setting the appropriate
constant in `App.tsx` to be `true`.

If you're interested in what data is available to you when rendering Tweets, feel free to plug the Tweets JSON file into
a [online JSON viewer](https://jsoneditoronline.org/).  Our type definitions also have a pretty good read of the data's
structure, although it is not perfect.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
